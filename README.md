This project shows how niche modelling can be used successfully for modelling terrorism.  Sample raster data is provided at https://www.dropbox.com/s/5846eonki10g78w/BIL.zip?dl=0, though it is encouraged to use different datasets.  Terrorism occurrence data is provided by the University of Maryland through the Global Terrorism Database available at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ Remember that the data and the rasters need to be in the same coorinate system, and the XY points needs to be added to the database and written to a CSV file.  Example CSV files have been provided (Terrorism against government, against business, etc).  A python script could be written to aid the process.  I have provided a sample script.

R could be used to perform the modeling, or the MaxEnt software could be used.  The MaxEnt java package is available at http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/ 

An example R script has been provided using the BIOMOD2 package
